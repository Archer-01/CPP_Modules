# CPP Modules

Welcome to the C++ Modules Repository! This collection consists of nine introductory modules designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the C++ programming language. Each module focuses on specific topics, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced features. Below is a brief summary of the content covered in each module:

## Module 00: Basics of C++
Covering essential building blocks such as namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other foundational concepts.

## Module 01: Memory and Pointers
Exploring memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the usage of the switch statement.

## Module 02: Polymorphism and Operator Overloading
Introducing ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form.

## Module 03: Inheritance
Delving into the concept of inheritance, a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming.

## Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism
Covering abstract classes, interfaces, and the implementation of subtype polymorphism.

## Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions
Examining repetition structures and the handling of exceptions in C++.

## Module 06: C++ Casts
Understanding the various C++ casting mechanisms and their applications.

## Module 07: C++ Templates
Introduction to the powerful concept of templates in C++, enabling generic programming.

## Module 08: Templated Containers and Algorithms
Exploring templated containers, iterators, and algorithms, providing a deeper understanding of generic data structures and their manipulation.

Feel free to explore each module at your own pace, gaining a solid understanding of the different facets of C++ programming. Happy coding!
